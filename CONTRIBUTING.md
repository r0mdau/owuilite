## Documentation Style Guide

### Markdown Formatting

- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Use fenced code blocks with language specification
- Use relative links for internal references
- Keep line length reasonable (80-120 characters when possible)

### Code Examples

```yaml
# Good: Include comments explaining non-obvious parts
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: openwebui
  namespace: openwebui
  annotations:
    # This annotation enables internal load balancing
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "true"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

### Command Examples

```bash
# Good: Include context and expected output
kubectl get pods -n openwebui
# Expected output:
# NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# openwebui-7d5b9c4f6d-abc12   1/1     Running   0          5m
```
